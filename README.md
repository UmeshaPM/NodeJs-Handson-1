<h1>1.What is Node.js</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Node.js is composed of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine, the libUV platform abstraction layer, and a core library that is written in JavaScript. </li>
  <li>Additionally, Node.js is based on the open web stack (HTML, CSS, and JS)</li>
  <li>Node.js provides developers a comprehensive tool for working in the non-blocking, event-driven I/O paradigm.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<h1>What is the Use Node.js ?</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Asynchronous and Event Driven − All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. 
  It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data.</li>
  <li>Very Fast − Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.</li>
  <li>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable − Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. 
  Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.</li>
</ul>
